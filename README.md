# Rest Fullstack

How to consume multiple Rest endpoints, using GraphQL architecture and tooling in frontend? This repository brings a sample of how to solve without needing Redux or manage many states. Yes, this is possible using the [apollo-link-rest](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest).

This project is based and inspired on [Restria](https://github.com/entria/restria) and architecture of the [Entria Fullstack](https://github.com/entria/entria-fullstack), by [Entria](https://github.com/entria/). I am very grateful for the collaboration and encouragement through open-source.
